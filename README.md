# Setup

Im trialing Cosmic-epoch as I enjoy sway a ton, but kinda need my desktop to be just works, and I wan't tiling, so Cosmic-epoch is the best solution even if its alpha and I have some issues I need to file bug reports for compositer wise.

I use jetbrains to code when I wanna just focus on code, but I'm also trying to learn a modal editor helix.

I also game hence steam.
